Steps to Run the frontend and backend of the website

1. Download and install Node.js from its official website. This will include both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
2. Save the provided project zip file to a directory on your computer.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file and note the path to the extracted folder for future reference.
4. Open Visual Studio Code and load the extracted project folder.
5. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by using the shortcut [Ctrl + `] or by navigating to the "View" tab and selecting "Terminal".
6. Once the terminal is open, split it into two sections so one can be used for the frontend and the other for the backend. You can use the command [ctrl + shift + 5]
7. In one terminal, navigate to the "client" directory, and in the other terminal, navigate to the "server" directory.
8. In both terminals, install the required Node.js modules using the "npm install" command.
9. In the terminal for the client, start the frontend development server. This will provide a local port number, which you can open in your browser by pressing "Ctrl + Click" on the link.
